# Predict-the-accuracy

### Project Overview
In the previous exercise, a dataset was created to predict which individuals among the infected population require immediate hospitalisation. The objective of this project is to utilise the prepared training and testing datasets to train a basic kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors) model. 
## Accuracy
The accuracy of the trained model is reported to be 0.584.
